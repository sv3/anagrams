  <h1>ANAGRAM LAND</h1>
  <div id="info">
    <p>A multiplayer game where you steal words by rearranging letters</p>
    <p>Press enter at any time to add a new letter to the communal pool. When you find a word you can make out of the letters, type it and press enter to claim it for yourself.</p>
    <p>You can steal other people's words by combining them with tiles from the pool. For example, if your opponent has the word
        <span class="inline-tiles">ğŸ„²â€‹ğŸ„°â€‹ğŸ…ƒ</span>
        , and the letter 
        <span class="inline-tiles">ğŸ„º</span> 
        is available in the pool, you can type 
        <span class="inline-tiles">ğŸ…ƒâ€‹ğŸ„°â€‹ğŸ„²â€‹ğŸ„º</span>
        to take all of those letters and combine them into your new word.</p>
    <p>However, you can only steal a word if you rearrange its letters or add at least one letter in the middle of the word. For example, you can't make 
        <span class="inline-tiles">ğŸ„²â€‹ğŸ„°â€‹ğŸ…ƒâ€‹ğŸ…‚</span>
        out of
        <span class="inline-tiles">ğŸ„²â€‹ğŸ„°â€‹ğŸ…ƒ</span>
        and
        <span class="inline-tiles">ğŸ…‚</span> 
        . That would be too easy!
    </p>
    <p>Oh and by the way, you can "steal" your own words too. It's a good way to stop other people from stealing them.
