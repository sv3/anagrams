October 2020 Charges:
 + $3       static IP
 + $3.96    Micro INstance with burstable CPU Americas
 = $6.96    Total

could save money with dynamic IP and dynamic DNS

after enabling SSL, had to add following to nginx.conf (inside "location /socket.io"):
    proxy_set_header Origin "";
    



APP STRUCTURE:

 - intro screen:
    - description of rules
    - (FUTURE) list of rooms with players in each (click to join)
        - each room has unique url at /room/<id>
    + new room button (optionally enter player name)

 - room:
    - for each player:
        - player name
        - words
    - letter pool
    - your words
    - last play description or attempted play feedback (on timeout?)
    - text entry field



ACTIONS:

 - try to play a word:
    - send word to server
    - if word is valid:
        - server sends updated word lists + pool + "x played WORD by stealing y" message to all clients in room 
    - if word is not valid:
        - server sends reason to originator
